This is a hobby project; it may never be functional.

It's 2015 and it seems like far too much programmer time is spent on mundane
    tasks which could be automated.
It takes a lot of expertise and knowledge to design efficient code.
However, adapting a particular algorithm to make use of specific data
    structures should be automated.
So it would be nice to have a high level language for expressing algorithms,
    which also supports type hints (or explicit specification of types) to
    generate efficient code in C/C++.
    

In brief: I want a high level language for describing algorithms which:
  1. can be automatically converted to C (or some other fast language),
  2. separates algorithmic logic from the data model
